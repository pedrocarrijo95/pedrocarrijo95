ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Pedro â€” also known as JavaBoy âš¡

I help cloud developers and architects cut through cloud-native complexity, adopt the right tools, and make smart technical decisions to build high-performing, scalable systems.

I'm also active in the tech community as a speaker, DevRel contributor, and mentor â€” having spoken at events like **JavaOne, TDC, Microsoft Build, Oracle Cloud World DevTour, SouJava and among other**.

ðŸ§© I build things using:
- Java (Helidon, Spring, GraalVM)
