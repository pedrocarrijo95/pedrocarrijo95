ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Pedro â€” also known as JavaBoy âš¡

I help Java Developers focus on practical cloud-native and Al skills that enhance what they already do best: building smart and scalable solutions with Java, empowering them to stand out as trusted technical voices on their teams, position themselves as go-to references, lead key projects, make smart decisions, and gain visibility across the organization.

ðŸ§  With over 9 years of experience (yes, I started at 14), I currently work as a **Senior Cloud Solution Engineer at Oracle**, leading strategic PoCs and helping enterprise clients optimize microservices architectures with Kubernetes, DevOps, CI/CD, messaging, and cloud-native patterns.

ðŸ’¡ Passionate about Java, AI, and emerging technologies, Iâ€™ve worked across ecosystems using Java, Python, Node.js, and more. I'm also active in the tech community as a speaker, DevRel contributor, and mentor â€” having spoken at events like **JavaOne, TDC, Microsoft Build, Oracle Cloud World DevTour, SouJava and among others**.

ðŸ§© I build things using:
- Java (Helidon, Spring, GraalVM)
- Kubernetes, DevOps, Containers
- GenAI, LangChain4j, LLMs
- Oracle Cloud, OpenAI, REST APIs
- Among others...

ðŸ“š I hold certifications in:
- âœ… Kubernetes (KCNA, CKAD)
